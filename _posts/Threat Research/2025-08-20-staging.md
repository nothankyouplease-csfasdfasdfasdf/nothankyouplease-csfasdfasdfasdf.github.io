# Overview

During Feburary 2026, *Ctrl-Alt-Intel* & *Have I Been Squatted* uncovered a finanically motivated threat actor, coined **Diesel Vortex**, that had stolen over 1.5k unique credentials for Western logisitics, trucking or transportation buisnesses via phishing. *Have I Been Squatted* managed to recover complete source code, including database dumps of the Phishing-as-a-service (PHaaS) platform used by **Diesel Vortex**, that was named *Global Profit* or *MC Profit Always*. 

*Ctrl-Alt-Intel*'s ascertains with high-confidence that Armenian speaking actors were targeting companies within this sector to divert cargo and steal goods. These threat actors leveraged vishing and used RMMs to access victim logisitic companies networks.   

Finally, *Ctrl-Alt-Intel* recovered evidence linking actors operating within **Diesel Vortex**, to buisnessmen based out of Russia in leadership positions of registered LLCs within Russia. Noteably, these companies were in the same sector, or adjecent sectors, to the ones targeted by **Diesel Vortex**.

# Digging deeper

The domain `yasomawork[.]space` made uncovering these potential connections possible. This domain was found within the source code of the footer for the admin login panel for the phishing login platform.

This was `njhTghagTGgYT\template\footer.php` within the source:

[![1](/assets/images/cargo/1.png){: .align-center .img-border}](/assets/images/cargo/1.png)
<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — Source Code Exerpt</p>

We can see the domain `yasomawork[.]space` was seen pointing to the IP address `45.130.41[.]81` on `2025-02-14`. 

We can see this was registered on `2025-02-11 16:51:57 GMT` using the below details from the RDAP information:

<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — <a href="https://client.rdap.org/?type=domain&object=yasomawork.space&follow-referral=1">RDAP Record</a></p>

The domain for the panel was registered using Russian provider `BEGET-RU` had the above personal details provided. The IP address `45.130.41[.]81` is a VPS also provided by beget.com

# Yuri Ivlev

We now have a name, phone number & email address. We can pivot on these to find associated LinkedIn, Facebook & Whatsapp accounts. These accounts were all named `Yura Ivlev`, `Yuri Ivlev`, or `Юрий Ивлев`. For the remainder of this blog, we will refer to this individual as **Yuri**.

Many of **Yuri**'s accounts linked to the emails & phone number had public photos, with post dates from 2014 to 2023:

[![3](/assets/images/cargo/3.jpg){: .align-center .img-border}](/assets/images/cargo/3.jpg)
<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — Facebook Photo (2014)</p>

[![4](/assets/images/cargo/4.jpg){: .align-center .img-border}](/assets/images/cargo/4.jpg)
<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — Whatsapp Photo (2023)</p>

Additional OSINT reveals **Yuri**'s email address was used on a Google maps account that left a review indicating he had visited Phuket Thaioland

<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zysZ4mirPRHZooyz9">Google Review in Phuket</a></p>

Additionally, we can see the email addresss `y.ivlev@gmail.com` also registered the domain `unx-defence[.]ru` on 8th December 2021. Noteably Beget was also used for this. 

From `2014` to `2025`, **Yuri** was a founder of the 5 below organisations:

| **Registration Date**| **LLC Name**  | **Translation** | **ИНН/Tax ID** | **Email**                | **Sector**   | **Ownership at creation** |

English translations of the company names will be used for the remainder of the blog. The first company is not much interest, although we can see 4 other LLCs that **Yuri** founded. Additionally, we can see a singular LLC, `Terminal X`, that **Yuri** had 67% ownership - registered under the email `nkazarinov[@]yandex[.]ru`. We'll get to this individual shortly. 

Russian classifies economic activities using OKVED codes, which specifies the type of organisation for taxation, statistics and regulation purposes. We can analyse the OKVED codes of the companies to try understand their day to day activities

## UNIX GROUP LLC 

On 8th Dec 2021, we saw the email `y.ivlev[@]gmail.com` register the domain `unx-defence[.]ru`. On June 2022, **Yuri** took ownership of the company "UNIX Group" using the email `y.ivlev[@]gmail.com`. Prior to this, *Ольга Олеговна Ивлева* (*Olga Olegovna Ivleva*) was the owner. We will see this name on future documents.

This organisation has registered for over 30 OKVEDs, with the main OKVED code being *46.90 — Non-specialized wholesale trade*. Additional OKVEDs were registered for *49.20.9 — Transportation of other cargo* & *52.10 - Warehousing and storage activities*: 

[![6](/assets/images/cargo/9.png){: .align-center .img-border}](/assets/images/cargo/9.png)
<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — <a href="https://www.tbank.ru/business/contractor/legal/1217700463529/okved/">UNIX Group OKVED code</a></p>

The domain `unx-group[.]ru` is the publicly accessible website for the company **UNIX GROUP LLC (7713484999)**:

[![7](/assets/images/cargo/4.png){: .align-center .img-border}](/assets/images/cargo/4.png)
<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — <a href="https://unx-group.ru/">UNIX Group website</a></p>

"UNIX Group, a trading and manufacturing company, is a direct partner of leading Chinese factories and offers a wide range of high-quality industrial and consumer raw materials". We can see they also have "Our own logisitics service for international transportation" and are in "Close cooperation with leading factories in Russia and China".

[![8](/assets/images/cargo/5.png){: .align-center .img-border}](/assets/images/cargo/5.png)
<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — <a href="https://unx-group.ru/">UNIX Group website</a></p>

This appears to be a legitimate registered buisness that comes along with a product catalog:

[![9](/assets/images/cargo/6.png){: .align-center .img-border}](/assets/images/cargo/6.png)
<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — <a href="https://unx-group.ru/">UNIX Group website</a></p>

Finally, on March 23rd 2022, we can see *UNIX GROUP LLC* was given an official certificate from a [Kyrgyzstan goverment trade system](https://swis.trade.kg/Doc/171c9c78-4b33-47d9-af94-74dbcec88700). This site is used to register and publish export/import-related documents like certificates:

<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — <a href="https://swis.trade.kg/Doc/171c9c78-4b33-47d9-af94-74dbcec88700">Kyrgyz trade certificate</a></p>

Noteably, although **Yuri**'s phone number & email address have been used here - the certificate is registered under the name *Olga Olegovna Ivleva*.

Using 1 Ruble = 0.013 USD: 

| **Year** | **Revenue (USD)** | **Net profit (USD)** | **Total assets (USD)** | **Equity (USD)** | **Total liabilities (USD)** |
| ---: | ------------: | ---------------: | -----------------: | -----------: | ----------------------: |
| 2021 |       $604.7k |            $2.0k |            $623.7k |        $2.1k |                 $621.6k |
| 2022 |       $54.42m |           $9.67m |            $26.19m |       $9.67m |                 $16.51m |
| 2023 |       $95.18m |          $16.27m |            $37.72m |      $22.88m |                 $14.84m |
| 2024 |      $154.89m |          $10.91m |            $67.77m |      $27.67m |                 $40.10m |

Public financial reporting for *UNIX Group* clearly shows a sharp scale-up into multi-billion-ruble revenue. In 2023, *UNIX Group* reported profits of **$16.27 million** with a net margin of **~17.1%**. For 2024, revenue increased too **154.89 million USD**, although due to selling and administrative expenses increasing,  the net margin decreased to 7% with **$10.9 million USD profit**.     

We have no evidence to prove these funds have originated from cargo theft, nor is Ctrl-Alt-Intel suggesting this. However, **Yuri**'s email, which is linked to a company with greater than $100m revenue in 2024, was identified registering a domain for **Diesel Jacakal**'s' phishing panel targeting companies within the logisitics sector.

It also happens that the company **Yuri** owns, which is linked to his personal email `y.ivlev[@]gmail.com`, is within the same sector as those targeted by **Diesel Vortex** - linked to cargo theft:

<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — Correlation Graph #1</p>

## Terminal X

This company was registered on July 13th 2023 by **Yuri** and a new individual **Nikita Kazarinov**, who had 33% ownership, using email `nkazarinov@yandex.ru`:

[![12](/assets/images/cargo/8.png){: .align-center .img-border}](/assets/images/cargo/8.png)
<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — Split ownership of Terminal X</p>

*Terminal X* has the below OKVED codes:

1. 52.10 - Warehousing and storage activities
2. 52.10.9 — Storage and warehousing of other cargo
3. 52.29 — Other auxiliary activities related to transportation
4. 82.99 - Activities to provide other support services to businesses, not included in other groups

*Terminal X*'s filings show zero revenue reported across 2023-2025, although has had small losses each year: **-2.8k USD** (2023), **-5.9k** (2024), **-5.4k** (2205)

Please see the detailed [T-Bank](https://www.tbank.ru/business/contractor/legal/1217700400741/financial-statements/) for further information. 

# Nikita Kazarinov

On February 20nd 2026 (2 days before writing this), **Nikita** took full ownership of the *Terminal X LLC*, leaving **Yuri** with no shares:

[![13](/assets/images/cargo/15.png){: .align-center .img-border}](/assets/images/cargo/15.png)
<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — Yuri leaving Terminal X</p>

**Nikita** also owned multiple related LLCs prior to founding *Terminal X* with **Yuri**:

## Shuttle Logisitic / Terminal Plus + Broker


## Terminal Plus 

> Founded by `Veryakov Evgeny Nikolaevich`

Both LLCs *Terminal Plus* & *Terminal  Broker* can be found associated with the organisation "Shuttle Logisitics Solutions" that is hosted on the domain `shuttle-logistic[.]ru`:

<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — <a href="https://shuttle-logistic.ru/company_details/">Shuttle Logistics website</a></p>

Unlike *UNIX Group*, the Shuttle Logisitics website has names and photos of employees, including the same **Nikita Kazarinov** we saw as a registered owner:

<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — <a href="https://shuttle-logistic.ru/company_details/">Nikita Kazarinov</a></p>

Further OSINT reveals this is a reputable company, with the CEO *Nikita Kazarinov* referenced multiple times by the Russian Logisticis news website, logisrus[.]ru:

# Network of LLCs

So far we've seen 6 Russian LLCs that are either owned by **Nikita Kazarinov** or **Yuri Ivlev**. The public websites surrounding these companies or official OKVED reporting reveal they likely:

* Sell/trade various wholesale goods
* Have access to warehouses to store goods/cargo
* Have the ability to transport cargo/goods

Interestingly, there was actually more in common to be explored.  

[![15](/assets/images/cargo/18.png){: .align-center .img-border}](/assets/images/cargo/18.png)
<p class="figure-caption">Figure X — Correlation Graph #2</p>
 
Interestingly, 5 of the Russian LLCs were registered to the same address, *117105, Г.Москва, Наб Новоданиловская, Д. 4А* (*117105, Moscow, Novodanilovskaya Embankment, Bldg. 4A*). 

In October 2025, **Yuri** broke this pattern - registering a new LLC at *141595, Московская обл, г Солнечногорск, тер Индустриальный парк Есипово (д Ложки), стр 16А, помещ 5* (*141595, Moscow region, Solnechnogorsk, Esipovo Industrial Park (Lozhki village), building 16A, room 5*).
